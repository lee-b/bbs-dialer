= BBS Dialer

BBS Dialer is a tool designed for Linux and other Unix-like systems, including BSD, offering a modern approach to accessing Bulletin Board Systems (BBS). It combines the classic feel of BBS with the advanced capabilities of contemporary terminals. 

== Overview

BBS Dialer simplifies the process of connecting to and managing BBS entries. It supports various connection protocols like Telnet, SSH, and HTTPS and allows for aggregation of BBS entries from different sources, including local directories and GitHub repositories.

== Features

* Easy-to-use, interactive menu for managing BBS entries.
* Support for Telnet, SSH, and HTTPS connections.
* Ability to integrate BBS entries from multiple sources.
* Unicode support for better character encoding handling.
* Eliminates the need for serial port emulation and the complexity of using an emulated terminal.

== Compatibility

The tool is designed to work on Unix-like systems such as Linux and BSD. It may also be compatible with modern terminal solutions like Windows Terminal.

== Getting Started

For instructions on installation, usage, and configuration, refer to the sections below.

== Installation

BBS Dialer can be installed either from PyPI, directly from the source, or using the provided wheel files (*.whl) from the GitHub releases.

=== System Requirements

**First, install https://linux.die.net/man/1/dialog[dialog(1)] on your system.**

=== From PyPI

Install BBS Dialer using pip:

[source, bash]
----
pip install bbs-dialer
----

=== From GitHub Release

1. Download the latest `.whl` file from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lee-b/bbs-dialer/releases) page.
2. Install the wheel file using pip:
+
[source, bash]
----
pip install /path/to/downloaded/bbs_dialer-*.whl
----

Replace `/path/to/downloaded/bbs_dialer-*.whl` with the actual path to the downloaded wheel file.

=== From Source

1. Clone the repository:
+
[source, bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/lee-b/bbs-dialer.git
----

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
+
[source, bash]
----
cd bbs-dialer
----

3. Install the package using Poetry:
+
[source, bash]
----
poetry install
----

== Usage

Run the application via the command line with `bbs-dialer`. Use the interactive menu to manage and connect to BBS entries.

== Configuration

The configuration for BBS Dialer is managed through a YAML file, `config.yaml`, located at `~/.config/bbs-dialer/`. This file allows you to customize the source directories for BBS entries and the path for the cache file.

=== `config.yaml` File Format

The configuration file should be structured as follows:

[source, yaml]
----
source_dirs:
  - /path/to/first/source/directory
  - /path/to/second/source/directory
cache_file: /path/to/cache/file
----

* `source_dirs`: A list of directories where the BBS Dialer will look for BBS entry files (`*.yaml`). These directories can be local file system paths or remote locations such as GitHub repositories.

* `cache_file`: The path to the file where the aggregated BBS entries will be cached for quick loading.

=== BBS Entry Files

BBS entries are stored in YAML files in the directories specified in `source_dirs`. Each entry file contains one or more BBS entries formatted as follows:

[source, yaml]
----
- name: "BBS1"
  url: "telnet://bbs1.example.com"
  description: "Classic BBS on Telnet"
- name: "BBS2"
  url: "ssh://bbs2.example.com"
  description: "Secure BBS on SSH"
----

Each entry should include:

* `name`: The name of the BBS.
* `url`: The connection URL, which can be a telnet, ssh, or https URL.
* `description`: A brief description of the BBS.

=== Default Configuration

If the `config.yaml` file does not exist, the BBS Dialer will use the following default configuration:

* Default source directory: `~/.config/bbs-dialer/bbs_sources`
* Default cache file: `~/.cache/bbs-dialer/bbs_db.yaml`

Create and modify the `config.yaml` file and entry files as needed to customize your BBS directory.
